            Food is the source of life for out mere carbon-based bodies.
            The combination of flavours, good food can make enemies become friends.
            And bad food, friends, mortal enemies.
            We love the later part as we love a good fight.
            We have a boxing ring in the middle of the Restaurant
            An ambulance is parked outside in case of emergency.
            A pack of ice will bring down the pain most of the time. 
            So get your boxing gloves and bring your SO to our Restaurant.
            A problem solved now is better than never...
